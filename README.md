# Benny Bot

The bot that does basically you could ever need (WIP).

This is a bot I've made as an example of my learning of python version 3.8.4

Please note if somehow your seeing this, the bot is still in a "pre beta" stage, and is nowhere close to where it should be.

If you do think that this is an interesting project, come back to it later, and hopefully I've released v1 of the bot.
